# FEND/FSND Neighborhood Map project

This is a single-page application built primarily using the knockoutJS framework. The page details various places around Seattle, WA that I would like to visit. The google map API is used to generate the map and map markers. The page contains a list view and filter function for the places which updates the map markers accordingly. Additional information about each of the locations is provided through the wikipedia and NYT API's. 

## Set-up:
1. Clone the FreshMap repository: ```git clone https://github.com/p-mayor/FreshMap```
2. Open index.html in a web browser.
